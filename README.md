# About
- Things that I learned during CS345: Practice and Applications of Data Management in Umass Amherst. 
- Projects/labs were mainly done in SQL. 
- This course teach me a lot about the use of data management systems that can be used in
applications, with a strong emphasis on the relational database model. Some of the covered topics
include application-driven database design, schema refinement, implementation of basic transactions,
data on the web, and data visualization.
